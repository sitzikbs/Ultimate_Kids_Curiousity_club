# Maplewood - Oliver's World
# Setting for Oliver's Workshop STEM podcast

world_name: "Maplewood"
era_or_style: "modern suburban, slightly retro"

description: >
  A friendly, mostly-real suburban town where kids ride bikes, teachers know your name, and
  neighborhood bakeries smell like cinnamon. The small twist: Maplewood celebrates hands-on
  curiosity through people and shared resources rather than everyday visible contraptions.
  A kindly retired tinkerer, Mrs. Chen, tends a 'Curiosity Corner' in the public library and
  the elementary school hosts a modest Fab Lab for guided experiments. It's not magic — it's
  mentorship, community support, and playful problem-solving.

# Key Locations
key_locations:
  - name: "Oliver's Backyard Workshop"
    description: >
      A cluttered but cozy shed behind Oliver's house filled with spare parts, tools,
      sketches, and half-built gadgets — the central place where ideas become experiments.
    
  - name: "Maplewood Elementary School"
    description: >
      The local school where Oliver and his friends learn and where many social problems arise
      (lost homework, science-fair challenges). A place for lessons both academic and social.
    
  - name: "Maplewood Makers (Community Makerspace)"
    description: >
      A friendly community workshop run by volunteers where kids and adults share tools,
      teach workshops, and collaborate on larger builds. A hub for resources and mentors.
    
  - name: "Mrs. Chen's Curiosity Corner (Library Alcove)"
    description: >
      A small, characterful alcove inside the Maplewood Public Library tended by Mrs. Chen,
      a retired tinkerer. She keeps odd parts, notebooks of sketches, and a drawer of
      'curiosity bits' that kids can borrow. Mrs. Chen offers gentle guidance and surprising
      historical stories about simple machines.
    
  - name: "School Fab Lab (Maplewood Elementary)"
    description: >
      A modest fabrication corner at the school supervised by Ms. Park, equipped with
      safe, kid-friendly tools (3D pens, basic circuit kits, measuring tools) used in class
      projects and science fair prep. It's where formal STEM lessons meet hands-on practice.
    
  - name: "The Treehouse"
    description: >
      A neighborhood hideout built by the kids; it's used for brainstorming, secret tests of
      small inventions, and planning solutions away from prying grown-up eyes.

# World Rules
world_rules:
  - "No magic — inventive solutions come from curiosity, observation, and experimentation."
  - "Adults are generally supportive; kids solve problems together with guidance, not alone."
  - "Safety and learning matter: experiments should be tested, measured, and sometimes fail before they succeed."
  - "Every problem is an opportunity to learn a STEM concept and practice teamwork."
